# KRongBERT
The BERT model achieves remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing tasks for Latin alphabet-based languages. However, the Korean language, characterized by limited data resources and intricate linguistic structures, presents numerous challenges and constraints. In this paper, we introduce KRongBERT, a morphological approach tailored to effectively understand and analyze the unique features of the Korean language. KRongBERT mitigates the out-of-vocabulary issues that arise with byte-pair-encoding tokenizers in Korean and provides language-specific embedding layers to support in-depth understanding. Our experiments show that KRongBERT outperforms existing Korean text encoders.
